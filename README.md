# Trie Data Structure with Autocomplete in Rust

This is a quick late night exercise. The goal was to implement a trie data structure in rust and explore some of the features of Rust programming language. 

The Trie struct that I implemented can 1) insert new nodes from an array of strings and 2) search for all strings that begin with the user input.
